## Usage

### Scraping YouTube Channels

To scrape a YouTube channel, you need to provide the URL of the channel without the videos prefix. For example, if you want to scrape the channel https://www.youtube.com/@exampleChannel/videos, you would provide the URL as `https://www.youtube.com/@exampleChannel`.

### Downloading Audio

1. You will have to install ffmpeg and yt-dlp on your computer.
2. Run the downloader by running `ts-node youtubeAudioDownloaderCli.ts <path-to-your-youtube_content_*.json>` where `youtube_content_*.json` is the file generated by the scraper.
3. The downloader will download the audio files to the `downloaded_audio` folder.
4. If you run into authentication issues, you can try using the `--cookies` option with yt-dlp to provide your cookies. See the yt-dlp documentation for more information.
